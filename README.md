And i know i could be more creative
come up with poetic lines

But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
is the only thing that's on my mind
you take me higher, higher than i've ever been babe
just come over, let's pour a drink babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late
you light my fire


I want you to stay........
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer" 


Red yellow blue green. Youre welcome 


Fire is lit.
Commit to being lit.
Now you are lit.
Let's go be lit.


ADD A LAMA TO YOUR POEM
Not a panda?

pour me a drink of your deisre,
this way you can take me higher,
higher than i will ever be,
higher than i will ever go,
because you give me the strength to surge forward.

LAMA
